This library is just something I made for the purpose of being able to make 3d games in the console. It
isn't as clean and polished as I wanted it too at this point, but nevertheless I'm somewhat happy with it.

This library works almost entirely in plain c++, with just a model loading library to simplify it, a png
loading library, and a math library. No rendering library, as all the rendering is done by outputting characters to
the screen using the command line.
